# TextureArray-Terrain
I made this shader for unity default terrain.\n
It's a material surface shader with some cool effects like Parallax occlusion map, gradual snow.\n
It does use texture array so you will need support for that.\n
You will need a script to fill in the infos needed, like snow coef, the texture array, etc.\n
